# Supported Android Versions

The OneDrive picker library is supported at runtime for Android API revision 14 and greater. To build the picker library you need to install Android API revision 19 or greater.

The picker requires the OneDrive app to be installed, in order to function. If the OneDrive app is not installed, the user will be prompted to download the app when either the startPicking() or startSaving() method is invoked.
